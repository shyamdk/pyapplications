    In this blog I would like to reflect on how application development as a concept has evolved from 
    the main frame days to now, open source distributed world.
    
    how programming pradigm has evolved 
    how markets have moved and celerated opensource
    how monetization of products and services has changed
    how the eviornment has changed from booking slots to puch holes for mainframes to compnute on demand
